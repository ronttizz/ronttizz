### Toni Nissinen (Ronttizz)

Studying web development in Business College Helsinki, started Jan 2022.

At this time most of the repos are school projects. README files should be included in the repo and if the project is published it will have the link to it.

I am also content creator in Twitch, part of YMCA Esport stream team. Twitch channel is mostly about gaming, which I am passionate about, and something of my life outside profession and gaming.

For collaborations (coding, gaming, marketing etc) you can find me on many different social media:
